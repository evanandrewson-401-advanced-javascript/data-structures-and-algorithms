# FizzBuzzTree
Coding challenge #16

## Challenge
The challenge is to create a function that will replace values in the tree divisible by 3 with fizz, divisible by 5 with buzz, and divisible by both with fizzbuzz.

## Approach & Efficiency 
I checked if the value was divisible by the above numbers and replaced it accordingly. I then recursively did the same for each of the left and right values of the root.
