# Reverse an Array
Coding challenge #4

## Challenge
The challenge is to create a linked list with methods to add a node to the beginning, check if a value is in the list, and return all the values in the list as a string.

## Approach & Efficiency 
For inserting a new node, I created a new node and reset the head to be that node. For includes, I looped through the linked list and checked if the value matched the inputted value. For toString, I looped through the linked list and added each value to an array that I then called .join on.
