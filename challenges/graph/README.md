# Reverse an Array
Coding challenge class #35

## Challenge
The challenge is to create a graph class with methods for addNode, addEdge, getNodes, getNeighbors, and size.

## Approach & Efficiency 
In order to create this class, we instantiate with a Map instance for the node list. The key for each item in the Map is the value of the node, and the value of the item is an array of the associated edges.
